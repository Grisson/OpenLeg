## OpenLeg

OpenLeg started as my senior design Project for ECE445 at UIUC. The goal of the project is to provide a fully open source robotic leg capable of fast dynamic movements for research and development of quadrupedal robots. OpenLeg is intedned to make development of robotic legs and associated algorithms accessible to hobbyists and researchers with tight schedules or budgets. 

All files required for replicating OpenLeg will be provided along with an assembly guide. 

Please reach out if you are interested in building the leg or contributing to the project.

Thanks to my Senior Design partners Kanyon Edvall and Ahsan Qureshi for helping realize the project in the tight schedule of just one semester. Watch our Senior Design demo video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXOSeKpADnk
