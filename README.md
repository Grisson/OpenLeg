## Open**Leg**

OpenLeg started as my senior design Project for ECE445 at UIUC. The goal of the project is to provide a fully open source robotic leg capable of fast dynamic movements for research and development quadrupedal robots. OpenLeg is intedned to make development of robotic legs and associated algorithms accessible to hobbyists and researchers with tight schedules or budgets. All files required for replicating OpenLeg are provided along with an assembly guide.
